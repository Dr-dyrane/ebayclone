# üé® The Ultimate Guide: Building an eBay Product Page

Hello, aspiring developer! Welcome to a comprehensive, step-by-step adventure where we will deconstruct and rebuild a modern webpage inspired by a real eBay listing. This is not just a simple tutorial; it's a deep dive into the building blocks of the web.

By the end, you will have a pixel-perfect clone and, more importantly, a solid understanding of how professional websites are built.

### ‚≠ê The Final Product

We are going to meticulously build this feature-rich product page. It includes a header, search bar, image gallery, detailed product information, action buttons, and a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

### ‚ú® The Three Core Technologies

We will master the three essential languages of the web.

1.  **HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - The Architect üèõÔ∏è**

    - **Purpose:** To structure the content. HTML defines every element on the page: every header, paragraph, image, and button.
    - **In this project:** We'll create a complex hierarchy of nested `divs`, semantic tags like `<header>` and `<footer>`, and elements for user interaction like `<input>` and `<button>`.

2.  **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - The Designer üé®**

    - **Purpose:** To style the HTML. CSS controls colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and animations.
    - **In this project:** We will use modern CSS techniques including **CSS Variables**, **Flexbox** for alignment, **CSS Grid** for complex layouts, pseudo-classes for interactive effects (`:hover`), and **media queries** for responsive design.

3.  **JavaScript - The Engineer ‚öôÔ∏è**
    - **Purpose:** To make the page interactive and dynamic. JavaScript handles user actions, manipulates the page, and responds to events.
    - **In this project:** We will write scripts to handle image thumbnail clicks, create pop-up overlays, and make our action buttons respond to the user.

### üó∫Ô∏è The Project Roadmap (Chapters)

This project is broken down into manageable chapters. Follow them in order to build the page from the ground up.

- **[Chapter 1: The Foundation](./chapter-1-foundation.md)**

  - Set up our HTML file and apply fundamental CSS, including a reset and CSS variables for our color palette.

- **[Chapter 2: The Header and Search Bar](./chapter-2-header-and-search.md)**

  - Build the complex header section with its navigation and functional-looking search bar using HTML and Flexbox.

- **[Chapter 3: The Product Gallery](./chapter-3-product-gallery.md)**

  - Create the image gallery, including the main image and the scrollable thumbnails below it.

- **[Chapter 4: The Product Information](./chapter-4-product-info.md)**

  - Add the product title, price, seller information, and the main action buttons (`Buy It Now`, `Add to cart`).

- **[Chapter 5: Details and Layout with CSS Grid](./chapter-5-details-and-layout.md)**

  - Assemble the gallery and info sections into a single component using CSS Grid, and add the remaining detail sections.

- **[Chapter 6: JavaScript Magic - Interactivity](./chapter-6-javascript-magic.md)**

  - Bring the page to life! Write JavaScript to make the image thumbnails update the main image and make the buttons interactive.

- **[Chapter 7: Responsive Design for All Devices](./chapter-7-responsive-design.md)**
  - Implement media queries to ensure our page looks fantastic on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
